Use this pattern when you want a scheduled workflow to inspect other agentic workflows, summarize what happened, and escalate unusual cost or failure patterns.

The [agentic-ops repository](https://github.com/githubnext/agentic-ops) provides the reference implementation for this approach.

## What this pattern does

This pattern reviews workflow logs across a repository, classifies notable behavior, and publishes a structured report. When it detects repeated failures, abnormal token consumption, or other unhealthy patterns, it can escalate those findings into issues for follow-up.

This pattern is useful for repository-wide monitoring because it creates a durable operational record instead of relying on ad hoc inspection of individual workflow runs.

## Typical workflow

1. Run on a schedule to collect recent workflow activity.
2. Analyze logs, costs, and failure signals across runs.
3. Post a summary report to a GitHub Discussion or another durable destination.
4. Open or update issues when the same problem crosses a threshold.

## When to use it

Use this pattern when a repository has enough workflow activity that maintainers need a regular summary instead of checking each run manually. It also helps when workflows span multiple teams and failures or waste need to be surfaced in a shared location.
