description: How to configure the runs-on field to target self-hosted runners in agentic workflows.
---

Use the `runs-on` frontmatter field to target a self-hosted runner instead of the default `ubuntu-latest`.

> [!NOTE]
> Runners must be Linux with Docker support. macOS and Windows are not supported.
>
> Self-hosted runners must allow `sudo` for agentic workflows. This is a requirement to allow all GH-AW security features to be enabled. Specific technical needs are:
>
> - AWF (Agentic Workflow Firewall) applies host-level `iptables` rules to the Linux kernel `DOCKER-USER` chain to enforce network egress filtering for all agent containers on the AWF bridge network. This outer security boundary requires root UID.
>
> - Container-level `iptables`, Squid proxy ACLs, and capability drops add additional defense in depth, but they do not replace host-level filtering.

For these reasons, a non-sudo mode is not supported, including ARC configurations with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`.

## ARC with Docker-in-Docker (DinD)

Actions Runner Controller (ARC) deployments that use a Docker-in-Docker sidecar split the runner container and the Docker daemon container across separate filesystems, so bind mounts constructed from the runner's perspective fail inside the daemon.

`gh aw compile` emits a runtime probe in generated workflows that inspects `DOCKER_HOST` and appends `--docker-host-path-prefix /tmp/gh-aw` to the AWF invocation when the value matches `tcp://localhost:<port>` or `tcp://127.0.0.1:<port>`. No workflow-level configuration is required.

The probe is gated on AWF `v0.25.43` or newer. Workflows pinned to an older AWF version, or running on GitHub-hosted runners (where `DOCKER_HOST` is unset or points at a Unix socket), are unaffected.

## runs-on formats

**String** — single runner label:

```aw
---
on: issues
runs-on: self-hosted
---
```

**Array** — runner must have *all* listed labels (logical AND):

```aw
---
on: issues
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
---
```

**Object** — named runner group, optionally filtered by labels:

```aw
---
on: issues
runs-on:
  group: my-runner-group
  labels: [linux, x64]
---
```

## Sharing configuration via imports

`runs-on` must be set in each workflow — it is not merged from imports. Other settings like `network` and `tools` can be shared:

```aw title=".github/workflows/shared/runner-config.md"
---
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - private-registry.example.com
tools:
  bash: {}
---
```

```aw
---
on: issues
imports:
  - shared/runner-config.md
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
---

## Configuring the detection job runner

When [threat detection](/gh-aw/reference/threat-detection/) is enabled, the detection job runs on the agent job's runner by default. Override it with `safe-outputs.threat-detection.runs-on`:

```aw
---
on: issues
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
safe-outputs:
  create-issue: {}
  threat-detection:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
---
```

This is useful when your self-hosted runner lacks outbound internet access for AI detection, or when you want to run the detection job on a cheaper runner.

## Configuring the framework job runner

Framework jobs — activation, pre-activation, safe-outputs, unlock, APM, update_cache_memory, and push_repo_memory — default to `ubuntu-slim`. Use `runs-on-slim:` to override all of them at once:

```aw
---
on: issues
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
runs-on-slim: self-hosted
safe-outputs:
  create-issue: {}
---
```

> [!NOTE]
> `runs-on` controls only the main agent job. `runs-on-slim` controls all framework/generated jobs. `safe-outputs.runs-on` still takes precedence over `runs-on-slim` for safe-output jobs specifically.

## Configuring the maintenance workflow runner

The generated `agentics-maintenance.yml` workflow defaults to `ubuntu-slim` for all its jobs. To use a self-hosted runner for maintenance jobs, set `runs_on` in `.github/workflows/aw.json`:

**Single label:**

```json
{
  "maintenance": {
    "runs_on": "self-hosted"
  }
}
```

**Multiple labels** (runner must match all):

```json
{
  "maintenance": {
    "runs_on": ["self-hosted", "linux", "x64"]
  }
}
```

This setting applies to every job in `agentics-maintenance.yml` (close-expired-entities, cleanup-cache-memory, run_operation, apply_safe_outputs, create_labels, validate_workflows, and activity_report). Re-run `gh aw compile` after changing `aw.json` to regenerate the workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> `aw.json` is separate from individual workflow frontmatter. It provides repository-level settings for generated infrastructure workflows.
