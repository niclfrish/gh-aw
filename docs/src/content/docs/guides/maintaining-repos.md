Open-source maintainers face a unique challenge when running agentic workflows: anyone can open an issue or PR, triggering agent runs that consume compute and tokens — but not every contributor is equally trustworthy. gh-aw addresses this with two complementary safety mechanisms:

- **Safe-outputs** — The primary mechanism for controlling *what an agent can do*. Every GitHub mutation (opening issues, commenting, creating PRs) must be explicitly declared; anything not listed is blocked.
- **Integrity filtering** — The primary mechanism for controlling *what content the agent sees*. Content from untrusted authors is filtered from the agent's context before the run starts.

Together they form a defense-in-depth model: integrity filtering keeps untrusted content out of the agent's context, and safe-outputs ensure the agent can only produce authorized side-effects. This guide shows how to use **repo-assist** as the primary entry point for managing incoming work, and how to configure both mechanisms so your repository scales safely.

## Repo-Assist as Your Triage Layer

Repo-assist is a workflow that runs on every new issue or PR, classifies the content, and routes work to the right place. It is the recommended starting point for any public repository because it:

- Sees all incoming content (including from untrusted users), so nothing is silently ignored.
- Applies lightweight, low-cost classification (labels, comments) rather than heavy agent actions.
- Acts as a gate that downstream code-modifying agents depend on before they run.

A minimal repo-assist workflow:

```aw wrap
---
description: Triage incoming issues and route to appropriate agents
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues, labels]
    min-integrity: unapproved
safe-outputs:
  label-issue:
  comment-issue:
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
---

Review the newly opened issue. Based on the issue content:

1. Apply the most relevant label from the existing label set.
2. If the issue is a quality bug report with a clear reproduction, add the label `needs-investigation`.
3. If the issue is from a maintainer or collaborator, add `trusted-contributor` and consider assigning the Copilot coding agent to investigate.
4. If the issue appears to be spam or off-topic, add `invalid` and post a brief explanation comment.
5. Otherwise, post a comment thanking the contributor and explaining what information is still needed.
```

`min-integrity: unapproved` allows repo-assist to see content from contributors who have previously interacted with the repository — including first-time contributors and users who have had PRs merged before — while still filtering out content from brand-new GitHub users (`FIRST_TIMER`) and users with no repository association (`NONE`). For most active repositories, this captures the vast majority of community input. The `safe-outputs` block limits what repo-assist can do in response: it can only apply labels and post comments. Any other GitHub mutation (opening PRs, merging, closing issues) is blocked by the runtime, regardless of what the agent attempts.

### Routing to Downstream Agents

Downstream agents that do heavier work (code fixes, PR reviews, issue resolution) are triggered by the labels repo-assist applies. They use stricter integrity filtering to ensure they only act on trusted input:

```text
Issue opened (any author)
  → Repo-assist (min-integrity: unapproved)
      Classifies content and applies labels
      Adds "trusted-contributor" for owners/members/collaborators
      Assigns Copilot if label indicates ready work
  → Code fix agent (min-integrity: approved, approval-labels: ["needs-investigation"])
      Triggered by label, runs only when repo-assist has approved the issue
      Safe from untrusted input by construction
```

The code fix agent:

```aw wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues, pull_requests]
    min-integrity: approved
    approval-labels:
      - "needs-investigation"
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
permissions:
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  contents: write
---

The issue labeled `needs-investigation` needs a fix. Reproduce the bug,
implement a minimal fix, and open a pull request.
```

This separation means compute-intensive agents only run after repo-assist has classified and approved the work.

## Controlling Workflow Outputs with Safe-Outputs

Safe-outputs is the primary mechanism for controlling what a workflow can do. Every action that produces a side-effect on GitHub — labeling an issue, posting a comment, opening a pull request, merging — must be explicitly declared in the `safe-outputs:` block. If an action isn't listed, the runtime blocks it before it reaches the API.

This is what makes it safe to run repo-assist with `min-integrity: unapproved`: even if the agent were to generate an instruction to open a PR or close an issue, the runtime would reject it because those outputs weren't declared.

The available safe-outputs map directly to GitHub actions:

| Safe-output | What it allows |
|------------|---------------|
| `label-issue` | Apply or remove labels on an issue |
| `comment-issue` | Post a comment on an issue |
| `comment-pull-request` | Post a comment on a pull request |
| `create-pull-request` | Open a new pull request |
| `merge-pull-request` | Merge a pull request |
| `close-issue` | Close an issue |
| `create-issue` | Open a new issue |
| `assign-issue` | Assign an issue to a user or team |

**Principle of least privilege**: Declare only the outputs the workflow actually needs. A repo-assist workflow that classifies issues should declare `label-issue` and `comment-issue`, not `create-pull-request`.

```aw wrap
# Repo-assist: can only label and comment
safe-outputs:
  label-issue:
  comment-issue:
```

```aw wrap
# Code fix agent: can create and update pull requests
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
  comment-pull-request:
```

When a safe-output validation failure appears in your audit logs, it means the agent attempted an action that wasn't declared. See [Safe Outputs Reference](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/) for format requirements and complete output type documentation.

## Controlling Workflow Inputs with Integrity Filtering

Integrity filtering is the primary mechanism for controlling what content the agent sees. It evaluates the author of each issue, PR, or comment and removes items that don't meet the configured trust threshold — before the agent's context is assembled. Every public repository automatically applies `min-integrity: approved` as a baseline — repo-assist overrides this to `unapproved` so it can see issues from contributors and first-time contributors, not just trusted members.

The four configurable levels, from most to least restrictive:

| Level | Who qualifies |
|-------|--------------|
| `merged` | PRs merged into the default branch; commits reachable from main |
| `approved` | Owners, members, collaborators; non-fork PRs on public repos; recognized bots (`dependabot`, `github-actions`) |
| `unapproved` | Contributors who have had a PR merged before; first-time contributors |
| `none` | All content including users with no prior relationship |

Choose based on what the workflow does:

- **Repo-assist / triage workflows**: `unapproved` — classify content from contributors and first-time contributors without acting on it.
- **Code-modifying workflows** (open PRs, apply patches, close issues): `approved` or `merged` — only act on trusted input.
- **Spam detection or analytics**: `none` — see everything, but produce no direct GitHub mutations.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting `min-integrity: none` on a public repository disables the automatic protection. Only use it when the workflow is designed to handle untrusted input safely.

### Fine-Grained Trust Controls

Beyond the global level, three per-item overrides let you handle edge cases without changing the baseline.

**`trusted-users`** — Elevate specific accounts (contractors, bots) to `approved` regardless of their GitHub author association:

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
    trusted-users:
      - "contractor-alice"
      - "partner-org-bot"
```

**`approval-labels`** — Let repo-assist (or a human reviewer) label content to pass it through a stricter downstream filter:

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
    approval-labels:
      - "agent-approved"
      - "needs-investigation"
```

**`blocked-users`** — Unconditionally block known-bad accounts regardless of `min-integrity`:

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
    blocked-users:
      - "known-spam-bot"
```

To manage these lists across multiple workflows without duplicating them, store them in GitHub repository or organization variables:

| Workflow field | GitHub variable |
|---------------|----------------|
| `blocked-users` | `GH_AW_GITHUB_BLOCKED_USERS` |
| `trusted-users` | `GH_AW_GITHUB_TRUSTED_USERS` |
| `approval-labels` | `GH_AW_GITHUB_APPROVAL_LABELS` |

The runtime automatically merges per-workflow values with the variable. Set these under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**.

### Reactions as Trust Signals

Starting from gh-aw v0.68.2, maintainers can use GitHub reactions (👍, ❤️) to promote content past the integrity filter without modifying labels. This is useful in repo-assist workflows where a maintainer wants to fast-track an external contribution.

To enable reactions, add the `integrity-reactions` feature flag:

```aw wrap
features:
  integrity-reactions: true
tools:
  github:
    min-integrity: approved
```

The compiler handles the rest — when `integrity-reactions: true` is set, it automatically:

- Enables the CLI proxy (`cli-proxy: true`), which is required for reaction-based integrity decisions
- Injects default endorsement reactions: `THUMBS_UP`, `HEART`
- Injects default disapproval reactions: `THUMBS_DOWN`, `CONFUSED`
- Uses `endorser-min-integrity: approved` (only reactions from owners, members, and collaborators count)
- Uses `disapproval-integrity: none` (a disapproval reaction demotes content to `none`)

These defaults mean that when a trusted member (owner, member, or collaborator) adds a 👍 or ❤️ reaction to an issue or comment, the item's integrity is promoted to `approved` — making it visible to agents using `min-integrity: approved`. Conversely, a 👎 or 😕 reaction from a trusted member demotes the item to `none`.

See the [Integrity Filtering Reference](/gh-aw/reference/integrity/) for complete configuration details.

## Scaling Strategies

### Token Budget Awareness

Integrity filtering directly reduces token consumption: items filtered by the gateway never appear in the agent's context window. On a busy public repository, `min-integrity: approved` on downstream agents can reduce context size dramatically compared to seeing all activity.

Use `gh aw logs --format markdown --count 20` to track token trends over time. The cross-run report surfaces cost spikes, anomalous token usage, and per-run breakdowns so you can detect regressions before they accumulate.

### Rate Limiting

The `rate-limit` frontmatter key caps how many times a workflow can run in a sliding window, preventing a flood of incoming issues from exhausting compute or inference budget:

```aw wrap
rate-limit:
  max-runs: 5
  max-runs-window: 60
```

See [Rate Limiting Controls](/gh-aw/reference/rate-limiting-controls/) for full options.

### Concurrency Controls

Workflows automatically use dual concurrency control (per-workflow and per-engine). For repo-assist, you may want higher concurrency so multiple issues are triaged in parallel rather than queued:

```aw wrap
concurrency:
  max-parallel: 3
```

### Scoping Repository Access

`allowed-repos` prevents cross-repository reads that aren't necessary for the workflow's task:

```aw wrap
tools:
  github:
    allowed-repos: "myorg/*"
    min-integrity: approved
```

This is useful in monorepo or multi-repo setups where the agent should only read from the organization's own repos.

## Debugging Failed Workflows

### Quick Start: AI-Assisted Debugging

The fastest path to a root cause is to hand the failing run URL to the Copilot CLI:

```bash
copilot
```

Inside the CLI:

```text
/agent agentic-workflows

Debug this run: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID
```

The agent loads the `debug-agentic-workflow` prompt, audits the run, and explains what went wrong. Follow up with specific questions about blocked domains, missing tools, or safe-output failures.

On GitHub.com with [agentic authoring configured](/gh-aw/guides/agentic-authoring/):

```text
/agent agentic-workflows debug https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID
```

### Manual Debugging with CLI Commands

**Audit a specific run:**

```bash
gh aw audit RUN_ID
gh aw audit RUN_ID --json    # machine-readable output
gh aw audit RUN_ID --parse   # writes log.md and firewall.md
```

The audit report covers: failure summary, tool usage, MCP server health, firewall analysis, token metrics, and missing tools.

**Analyze logs across multiple runs:**

```bash
gh aw logs my-workflow
gh aw logs my-workflow --format markdown --count 10
gh aw logs --filtered-integrity    # only runs with DIFC-filtered events
```

**Compare two runs for regressions:**

```bash
gh aw audit diff BASELINE_ID CURRENT_ID
```

### Common Failure Patterns

**Missing tool calls**

The agent attempted a tool that wasn't configured or used the wrong name. Check the `missing_tools` section of the audit output.

Fixes:
- Add the required tool to the `tools:` section in frontmatter.
- Verify safe-output names don't have an incorrect prefix (`safeoutputs-` is wrong; use the tool name directly).
- Check MCP server connectivity.

**Authentication failures**

Token permissions are too narrow or an API key is missing.

Fixes:
- Review the `permissions:` block in the workflow frontmatter.
- Ensure required secrets (`COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) are set.
- Check [Authentication Reference](/gh-aw/reference/auth/) for token requirements.

**Integrity filtering blocking expected content**

The `DIFC_FILTERED` events in the audit's firewall section show exactly which items were removed and why.

Fixes:
- Verify the author's GitHub association matches your `min-integrity` setting.
- Add the author to `trusted-users` if they should be promoted.
- Add `approval-labels` to allow label-based promotion.
- Use `gh aw logs --filtered-integrity` to find all runs with filtering events.

**Safe-output validation failures**

The agent attempted a GitHub action (label, comment, PR, etc.) that wasn't declared in the `safe-outputs:` block. Safe-outputs is the primary output safety mechanism — only declared actions are permitted.

Fixes:
- Review `safe-outputs:` configuration in frontmatter.
- Check `safe_outputs.jsonl` in the audit artifacts for the exact call that failed.
- See [Safe Outputs Reference](/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/) for format requirements.

**Token budget exhaustion**

The run hit the token limit before completing its task.

Fixes:
- Raise `min-integrity` to reduce the agent's context.
- Add `cache-memory:` to reuse context across runs.
- Simplify the prompt or break the workflow into smaller focused tasks.
- Set a tighter `rate-limit` to prevent concurrent runs from competing for the same token budget.

**Network blocks**

A domain the agent needs is blocked by the firewall.

Fixes:
- Review the firewall section of the audit output.
- Add the required ecosystem or domain to `network.allowed`.
- See [Network Configuration Guide](/gh-aw/guides/network-configuration/) for ecosystem identifiers.

### Iterative Debug Workflow

1. Check the workflow run summary in the GitHub Actions UI.
2. Run `gh aw audit RUN_ID` for a structured breakdown.
3. For complex issues, use `/agent agentic-workflows` in Copilot Chat.
4. Edit the `.md` file → run `gh aw compile` to validate → trigger a new run.
5. Compare the new run against the baseline with `gh aw audit diff`.

## Worked Examples

### Public Open-Source Repository

A public repository receives issues from anonymous users, contributors, and maintainers. Repo-assist triages all issues; a code fix agent only acts on issues that repo-assist has labeled as ready.

**Repo-assist** (`repo-assist.md`):

```aw wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues, labels]
    min-integrity: unapproved
safe-outputs:
  label-issue:
  comment-issue:
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
---

Classify the issue and apply one label from the existing label set.
If the issue is a quality bug report with a clear reproduction, also add the label `agent-ready`.
```

**Code fix agent** (`auto-fix.md`):

```aw wrap
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues, pull_requests]
    min-integrity: approved
    approval-labels:
      - "agent-ready"
safe-outputs:
  create-pull-request:
permissions:
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  contents: write
---

The issue labeled `agent-ready` needs a fix. Reproduce the bug,
implement a minimal fix, and open a pull request.
```

Repo-assist applies `agent-ready` when an issue meets quality criteria. The code fix agent uses `approval-labels` so even external issues promoted by repo-assist (or a maintainer) can be processed — while issues that haven't been approved are never seen by the code fix agent.

### Inner-Source Repository

An organization's internal repository should allow cross-team contributions. Members from partner teams don't have formal collaborator status but are trusted.

```aw wrap
---
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    allowed-repos: "myorg/*"
    min-integrity: approved
    trusted-users: ${{ vars.TRUSTED_PARTNER_ACCOUNTS }}
safe-outputs:
  comment-pull-request:
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read
---

Review the pull request for correctness, style, and test coverage.
Post a detailed review comment.
```

Partner team members are listed in the `TRUSTED_PARTNER_ACCOUNTS` organization variable. `allowed-repos: "myorg/*"` prevents the agent from reading data from external repos.

### High-Security Repository

A repository requiring auditability wants the agent to only act on code that is already in the default branch.

```aw wrap
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * *"
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    allowed-repos: "myorg/secure-repo"
    min-integrity: merged
    blocked-users: ${{ vars.GH_AW_GITHUB_BLOCKED_USERS }}
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
---

Scan the merged commits from the last 24 hours for security anti-patterns.
Open an issue for each finding with severity, location, and remediation steps.
```

`min-integrity: merged` ensures the agent only analyzes code that has passed code review and been merged. Even if a malicious PR was opened, it would never appear in the agent's context.
