# Startlight Docs

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## ⚠️ Known Dev-Mode Limitations

### Sitemap not available in dev mode

The sitemap (`/gh-aw/sitemap-index.xml`) is **only generated during a production build** (`npm run build`). It is not available when running the local development server (`npm run dev`).

If a CI pipeline or automated tool checks for the sitemap URL during a local preview, it will receive a 404 response. To verify the sitemap, run `npm run build` followed by `npm run preview`.

### Robots/AI discovery paths on GitHub Pages project sites

This docs site is deployed as a GitHub Pages **project site** under `/gh-aw/` (see `base: '/gh-aw/'` in `astro.config.mjs`).

- `robots.txt` is served at `/gh-aw/robots.txt`
- AI discovery file is served at `/gh-aw/.well-known/ai.txt`
- AI metadata files are served under `/gh-aw/ai/`

Root-level endpoints on `https://github.github.com/` (for example `/robots.txt`) are controlled by the main `github.github.com` site, not this repository.
