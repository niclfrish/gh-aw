# Shared Alerts — 2026-04-14T12:10Z

## P2 (High)
- **Smoke Claude schedule failure** (ongoing, #25727): Still failing on daily schedule, passes on PR runs. Environment-specific — schedule vs PR context divergence.
- **Smoke Cross-Repo PR Create/Update** (#25221, #25217, Apr 8): STALE 6 days. No fix applied. Needs escalation.
- **Schema Feature Coverage Checker** (#25992, Apr 13): Protected-files config blocks PR creation to .github/workflows/schema-demo-*.md. Fix: add `protected-files: fallback-to-issue` to frontmatter.
- **Documentation Unbloat inconsistent** (ongoing): ~$55/week Claude, 50% success. Cost gate needed.
- **Daily Firewall Logs** (#25456): safe_outputs process failure.
- **Smoke Multi PR** (#25415): persistent failure.
- **GitHub Remote MCP Auth Test**: 100% failure — #24829 closed not_planned. Test still failing.
