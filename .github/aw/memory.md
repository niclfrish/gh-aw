# Persistent Memory in Agentic Workflows

Consult this file when designing a workflow that needs to **persist state across runs** — deduplication, incremental processing, cross-run context, or knowledge accumulation.

> ⚠️ **`repo-memory` does NOT mean "cache-memory"**. They are two distinct tools with different backends, tradeoffs, and use cases. `cache-memory` is almost always the right first choice.

---

## Quick Decision Guide

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Skip already-processed items (deduplication) | `cache-memory` ✅ first choice |
| Round-robin processing across runs | `cache-memory` ✅ first choice |
| Store ephemeral run state, analysis notes, or intermediate results | `cache-memory` ✅ first choice |
| Track a numeric metric and compare current vs. baseline (runs at least every 7 days) | `cache-memory` ✅ first choice |
| Long-lived knowledge base visible in PRs and code reviews | `repo-memory` |
| Baselines that must survive cache expiry (e.g. security findings, dedup lists) | `repo-memory` |
| Human-readable wiki pages for knowledge accumulation | `repo-memory` with `wiki: true` |
| Persist notes/state inline on the triggering issue or PR | `comment-memory` |

**Default to `cache-memory` unless you have a specific reason to use `repo-memory`.**

---

## `cache-memory` — First Choice

Uses GitHub Actions cache (`actions/cache`) to persist a local filesystem directory populated by the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` MCP server. The directory lives at `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/`.

### When to use

- **Deduplication**: Track which items (issues, PRs, URLs, IDs) have already been processed
- **Round-robin / incremental processing**: Remember where you left off across scheduled runs
- **Ephemeral structured state**: JSON blobs, processing queues, intermediate analysis results
- **Metric baseline comparison**: Store a coverage %, score, or count and compare on the next run (see [Stateful Analysis / Baseline Comparison](#stateful-analysis--baseline-comparison) below)
- **Visual regression baselines**: Store screenshots between PR runs (see `visual-regression.md`)
- **Tool call caching**: Avoid redundant expensive API calls across runs

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  cache-memory: true
```

Advanced — custom key:

```yaml
tools:
  cache-memory:
    key: dedup-${{ github.event.schedule }}-${{ github.run_id }}
    retention-days: 30
    allowed-extensions: [".json"]
```

Multiple named caches:

```yaml
tools:
  cache-memory:
    - id: processed
      key: processed-items-${{ github.run_id }}
    - id: results
      key: results-${{ github.run_id }}
      retention-days: 14
```

### Storage path

- Single cache: `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/`
- Multiple caches: `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/{id}/`

### Deduplication example (scheduled workflow)

The following pattern lets a scheduled workflow skip items it has already processed:

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * *"
permissions:
  issues: read
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues]
  cache-memory: true
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[daily-digest] "
    close-older-issues: true
    labels: [automation]
timeout-minutes: 15
---

Fetch the 20 most recently updated open issues.

Load `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/processed.json` if it exists; it contains an array of
issue numbers already included in past digests.

Skip any issue whose number already appears in that array.

Summarize the remaining (new) issues. If there are none, use the `noop` safe output.

Before finishing, write the updated full list of processed issue numbers back to
`/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/processed.json` using a filesystem-safe timestamp:
`YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` (no colons, no `T`, no `Z`).
```

### Stateful Analysis / Baseline Comparison

Use `cache-memory` to persist a baseline metric between runs and detect regressions. This pattern is well-suited for any "compare current vs. previous" scenario — test coverage, build duration, benchmark scores, audit counts — where runs happen at least once every 7 days (the default cache retention).

**When to use this pattern**

- Tracking a numeric metric (coverage %, build time, test count, score) across scheduled or PR runs
- Alerting when a metric regresses by more than an acceptable threshold
- Any "tell me when X drops by more than Y" workflow where losing the baseline for a cycle is tolerable (the next run simply re-establishes it)

**When to use `repo-memory` instead**

If a lost baseline would cause serious side-effects — e.g. a security-finding baseline where "cache miss" floods the repo with duplicate issues — use `repo-memory`. See [Stateful Scanning Pattern (repo-memory)](#stateful-scanning-pattern-repo-memory) below.

**Worked example: coverage delta on every PR**

```markdown
---
description: Post a PR comment when test coverage drops by more than 1 percentage point
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions:
  pull-requests: read
  contents: read
engine: copilot
tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [pull_requests]
  cache-memory: true
safe-outputs:
  add-pr-comment:
    max: 1
timeout-minutes: 15
---

Run the test suite and collect the overall line-coverage percentage as a
single float (e.g. `82.5`).

Load `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/coverage-baseline.json` if it exists.
The file stores: `{ "coverage": 82.5, "updated": "2026-05-01-09-00-00" }`.

**First run** (file missing): write the current coverage to the file and use
the `noop` safe output — no comment is needed yet.

**Subsequent runs** (baseline found): compute `delta = current − baseline`.

- If `delta >= −1.0` (coverage held or improved), use the `noop` safe output.
- If `delta < −1.0` (coverage fell by more than 1 pp), post an `add-pr-comment`
  that includes:
  - Baseline coverage, current coverage, and delta (e.g. "82.5% → 79.3% (−3.2 pp)")
  - Which files lost the most coverage

Regardless of the outcome, overwrite `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/coverage-baseline.json`
with the current coverage and a filesystem-safe timestamp `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`
(no colons, no `T`, no `Z`).
```

**Key design decisions**

- **`cache-memory` not `repo-memory`** — coverage deltas are short-lived quality gates; a cache miss just means "no comparison this run" and the baseline is silently refreshed — no false-positive flood
- **First-run handling** — treat a missing baseline as "no data yet": write it and skip the comparison; the second run is the first real gate
- **Threshold guard** — ignore sub-1 pp fluctuations to reduce noise; tune the threshold to your team's standards
- **Filename safety** — use `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` (no colons) in any timestamped filenames written to `cache-memory`; see [Filename safety](#filename-safety) below

### Tradeoffs

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Zero repository noise — no commits, no PRs | Evicted when cache expires (default 7 days; use `retention-days` to extend up to 90) |
| Fast: no Git operations required | Not human-readable in GitHub UI |
| Works with Copilot, Claude, and custom engines | Data loss if cache is invalidated or expires |
| Supports multiple isolated caches per workflow | Files are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts — **no colons in filenames** |
| Scoped to workflow by default | |

### Filename safety

Cache-memory files are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts. **Artifact filenames must not contain colons** (NTFS limitation on Windows-hosted runners).

```bash
# ✅ GOOD — filesystem-safe timestamp
/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/state-2026-02-12-11-20-45.json

# ❌ BAD — colon in timestamp breaks artifact upload
/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/state-2026-02-12T11:20:45Z.json
```

When instructing the agent to write timestamped files, say explicitly:
> "Use filesystem-safe timestamp format `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS` (no colons, no `T`, no `Z`)."

## `repo-memory` — Long-lived Repository Knowledge

Uses a dedicated Git branch (default: `memory/agent-notes`) to store files that persist indefinitely until explicitly deleted. The directory lives at `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/`.

### When to use

- The knowledge needs to survive cache expiration
- You want the memory to be **visible in the repository** (auditable via Git history)
- The workflow accumulates a knowledge base that grows over time (e.g., architecture notes, known issues)
- You need changes to appear in diffs and be reviewable

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  repo-memory:
    branch-name: memory/agent-notes   # Optional: custom branch name
    target-repo: owner/other-repo     # Optional: store in another repo
    allowed-extensions: [".json", ".md"]
    max-file-size: 10240              # bytes
    max-file-count: 100
```

The compiler automatically creates a separate `push_repo_memory` job with `contents: write` permission. The main agent job retains read-only permissions.

### Tradeoffs

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Persists indefinitely (no expiry) | Produces Git commits — repository noise |
| Auditable: Git history shows every change | Produces Git commits — repository noise |
| Survives cache invalidation | Slower: requires Git clone + push |
| Human-readable via GitHub branch UI | Not available for Copilot engine (requires GitHub tools) |
| Can target a different repository | More complex setup |

---

## `repo-memory` with `wiki: true` — GitHub Wiki Backend

A variant of `repo-memory` that stores files in the **GitHub Wiki** (a separate Git repository at `<repo>.wiki.git`) instead of a branch.

### When to use

- You want structured, human-readable documentation pages
- The knowledge is intended for **human consumption** (wikis are browsable)
- You're building a living knowledge base or FAQ

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  repo-memory:
    wiki: true
    allowed-extensions: [".md"]
```

The compiler automatically creates a separate `push_repo_memory` job with `contents: write` permission. The main agent job retains read-only permissions.

Files follow GitHub Wiki Markdown conventions: use `[[Page Name]]` syntax for internal links, name files with hyphens instead of spaces.

### Tradeoffs

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Browsable in the GitHub Wiki UI | Produces Git commits to wiki repo |
| Great for human-readable knowledge bases | Produces Git commits to wiki repo |
| Standard Markdown with wiki link syntax | Restricted to `.md` files in practice |
| Separate from main repo history | Less suitable for structured JSON state |

---

## `comment-memory` — Managed Comment Persistence

Uses a dedicated `<gh-aw-comment-memory>` XML block in an issue or PR comment as persistent memory. The agent edits plain markdown files under `/tmp/gh-aw/comment-memory/`; the safe-output processor syncs the changes back to the managed comment.

### When to use

- Persist workflow notes or statuses visible inline on the triggering issue or PR
- State tied to the lifecycle of a specific issue or PR
- Structured running track records (status tables, checklists, summaries) the team can read without leaving the issue

Do NOT use `comment-memory` for high-volume ephemeral state (use `cache-memory`), long-lived knowledge bases (use `repo-memory`), or data that must survive across issues/PRs.

### Configuration

```yaml
tools:
  comment-memory: true   # enable with defaults
```

Advanced:

```yaml
tools:
  comment-memory:
    memory-id: status          # Optional: identifier in XML marker (default: "default")
    target: triggering         # Optional: "triggering" (default), "*", or explicit number
    target-repo: owner/other   # Optional: cross-repository
    max: 1                     # Optional: max updates per run (default: 1)
    footer: false              # Optional: omit AI-generated footer (default: true)
```

### How it works

1. **Pre-agent setup**: Reads `<gh-aw-comment-memory id="<memory-id>">` from the target comment and writes content to `/tmp/gh-aw/comment-memory/<memory_id>.md`.
2. **Agent**: Edits the markdown file directly — no explicit safe-output tool call needed.
3. **Post-agent**: The safe-output processor reads the edited file and upserts the managed comment, replacing only the XML-fenced block.

Multiple memory IDs are supported in a single comment; each maps to a separate `*.md` file.

### Tradeoffs

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|---|---|
| Visible in GitHub UI inline on the issue/PR | Requires `issues:write` or `pull-requests:write` |
| No separate branch or cache | One comment block per `memory-id` per target |
| Agent edits plain markdown — no tool call needed | Not suited for large structured data |
| Tied to issue/PR lifecycle | Not available without a triggering issue or PR |

## Stateful Scanning Pattern (repo-memory)

Use `repo-memory` to persist a baseline JSON file between scheduled runs so that the workflow only alerts on *new* findings — vulnerability scans, dependency audits, licence checks, or any "track changes over time" scenario.

### Example Workflow

```markdown
---
description: Nightly npm vulnerability scan — alerts only on new advisories
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 2 * * *"
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
engine: claude
tools:
  repo-memory:
    allowed-extensions: [".json"]
network:
  allowed:
    - registry.npmjs.org
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[vuln] "
    labels: [security, automated]
    max: 5
timeout-minutes: 20
---

Load `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/vuln-baseline.json`.
If missing, treat the baseline as `[]` (first run).

Run `npm audit --json`. Collect each advisory's id, severity, title, and URL.

Diff against the baseline:
- **New** (in current, not in baseline) → open a `create-issue` per finding (max 5).
- **Resolved** (in baseline, not in current) → log only.
- If no new findings, use the `noop` safe output.

Write the current advisory IDs to `/tmp/gh-aw/repo-memory/default/vuln-baseline.json` as a JSON array.
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **`repo-memory` for baselines, not `cache-memory`** — caches expire after 7 days; a lost baseline makes every known finding appear "new" on the next run, flooding the repo with duplicate issues
- **First-run handling** — treat a missing baseline file as `[]` and write it at the end of the first run, giving subsequent runs a clean starting point
- **`max:` flood guard** — caps issues opened per run; use `max: 5` for nightly scans, `max: 1` for secret alerts, `max: 10` for weekly audits
- **Engine restriction** — `repo-memory` requires Claude or a custom engine; it is **not available** for the Copilot engine
- **Baseline schema** — store only stable identifiers (advisory ID strings), not mutable fields like severity, to avoid false "new" alerts when metadata changes

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Do not invent `repo-memory` as a synonym for `cache-memory`** — they are different tools
- ❌ **Do not use `repo-memory` for ephemeral per-run state** — use `cache-memory`
- ❌ **Do not use `cache-memory` when you need indefinite persistence** — use `repo-memory`
- ❌ **Do not include colons in cache-memory filenames** — artifact upload will fail
